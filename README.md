HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej". 
                           Find inside of this project 1 class: 
                           Part 1 - compile, create object of type Part1 
                           and start function "tester" and select one
                           CSV file from Datasets folder (you can change manually
                           different CSV files and the input from code);
